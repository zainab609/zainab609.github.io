            <p>Long ago in Japan there was a little girl named Hoshi who was fascinated by the stars of the sky. She was absolutely in awe of them and would lie on the grass at night and stare at them for hours, wondering how the little bright specks of light could stay in the air for so long.</p>
            <p>One night while watching the stars, something happened in the sky that made her sad and she began to cry. The stars were falling out of heaven like a shower. So many of them were falling that she was afraid there would be no more.</p>
            <p>Suddenly she had an idea. Hoshi ran home and came back with a jar and some paper, and she sat down to watch the stars again. For every star that fell, Hoshi made a paper star and placed it in the jar. That night, she made one hundred stars. However, she was still sad because many more fell from the sky and she wasn't able to fold them all.</p>
            <p>The next night, there were only a few stars in the sky. Hoshi was worried but she had just one more idea. She ran and knocked on all the doors in the village and told all the little boys and girls to come out. She explained to them what was happening and they all wanted to help. That night they made two thousand stars and every child placed their own stars in their own jar.</p>
            <p>And then something magical happened, more stars began to appear in the sky and all the little boys and girls were happy. Hoshi spoke and said, "these stars are lucky because of us, from now on, these paper stars will be called lucky stars." Hoshi then looked up at the sky and said, </p>
            <span>"every time a lucky star is made, a falling star is saved."</span>
